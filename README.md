# Watt's Up 

Watt's Up is a Plotly Dash application with helpful load visualiziations and includes a  year (2024) load forecasting model for San Diego. 
The model along with the plots are simple, yet provide the needed information to forecast future loads by utilizing historical load and temperature data.
On top of load forecasts, this Dash application also asks the question if median househould income is correlated to average kWh usage. The application 
can only be deployed on my server. However, I have included pictures of the Dash application and the plots created (seen with files with.png).
